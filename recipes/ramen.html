                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>20 oz. fresh ramen noodles, or 12 oz. dried</li>
                <li>2 medium cooked chicken breast havles, sliced</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>For the garnish:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Soy sauce</li>
                <li>Sriracha (or other hot sauce)</li>
                <li>Handful fresh cilantro</li>
                <li>Lime wedges</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the scallions, garlic, carrot, mushrooms, and cabbage. Cook, stirring often, for 3 minutes, or until the vegetables soften.</li>
            <li>Stir in the ginger and brown sugar (if using) and cook for 30 seconds. Finally add the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>While the broth is simmering, bring a pot of water to a boil. Set a bowl of cold ice water nearby. </li>
            <li>Use a slotted spoon to gently lower the eggs, still in the shell, into the water. Simmer for 7 minutes for eggs that are soft and a little runny in the center, or 9 minutes for hard-boiled eggs. </li>
            <li>Transfer the eggs to the bowl of cold water and set aside until ready to serve. </li>
            <li>Return the pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook for 3 minutes, or according to the package directions, until tender. Drain in a colander. </li>
            <li>Divide the noodles among 4 large bowls. Ladle the broth and vegetables over the noodles.</li>
            <li>Remove the eggs from the ice water. Tap the shells with a spoon to crack and then peel off the shells. Pat the eggs dry and cut them in half.</li>
            <li>Top each bowl with the egg halves and the sliced chicken. Serve with soy sauce, hot sauce, cilantro leaves and lime wedges.</li>
        </ol>
